    <h2>Hunter's Stew</h2>
    <p>The concept of a hunter's stew dates back at least to the medieval period. The general gist is that a communal cook-pot is maintained over a never-extinguished fire, and is just continually refilled with scraps of game, food leftovers, spices, random vegetables or foraged foodstuffs, and the like. Essentially, it's a community-maintained bone button borscht that people add to and take from on an ongoing basis. Presumably, such a thing would also serve as a gathering site in the same way as a food truck or a water cooler.</p>
